# Self-RAG 报告

## 方法概览（Self-RAG 是什么）

Self-RAG（Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation）在生成前后引入**自我评估**与**自适应检索**：

- **是否检索**：模型先根据自评信号（如 *groundness*/事实扎实度、*utility*/上下文有用度、*seqscore*/序列一致性）判断需不需要取外部证据。
- **取什么检索结果**：从候选文段中打分并择优，尽量选取**对当下问题最有帮助**的证据。
- **如何生成**：在证据的支撑下生成答案，并可再次用自评信号筛选最终输出，降低幻觉、提升可核查性。

核心直觉：**让模型自己知道“何时需要看资料、该看哪段资料”，再回答**。

------

## 实验设置（20 条微型评测）

**数据**：Wikidata Category Dataset 的前 20 条问答任务（仅用问题）。
 **上下文构造**：对每个问题，我们用 *GPT-5 Thinking* 生成 3 段候选 ctx：

1. **低相关**：主题相近但细节偏差或不完整；
2. **完全无关**：与问题不相干的段落。
3. **高度相关**：内容与问题强相关、事实可支撑；

**模型**：llama2-7B

**运行命令**（自适应检索）：

```
python run_short_form.py \
  --model_name selfrag/selfrag_llama2_7b \
  --input_file eval_data/wiki_processed3.jsonl \
  --mode adaptive_retrieval --max_new_tokens 100 \
  --threshold 0.2 \
  --output_file outputfact \
  --metric match --ndocs 10 --use_groundness --use_utility --use_seqscore \
  --dtype half
```

要点说明：

- `--mode adaptive_retrieval` + `--threshold 0.2`：当自评信号认为“有帮助”时才用检索；阈值越高越保守。
- `--use_groundness/--use_utility/--use_seqscore`：综合“事实扎实度 + 有用度 + 序列一致性”多维信号来**打分与筛选**。
- `--ndocs 10`：最多可纳入 10 段候选文段（我们的 3 段 ctx 混在候选里）。

------

## 结果与对比

### 1) Self-RAG 选择了哪条 ctx？

检索编号选择统计（共 20 题）：

- 选择 **0 号**（低相关）: **3 次**
- 选择 **1 号**（无关）: **2 次**
- 选择 **2 号**（高度相关）: **15 次**

> 这与我们对三类 ctx 的设计一致：模型**大多数情况下选中了高度相关的 2 号**，少量情况下会挑到 0 号，极少数误选 1 号。

### 2) 与 **no-retrieve（不检索）** 的对比结论

- **准确性提升**：在如“南美洲鳄类”“排球电影”“南极植物”等问题上，**不检索**时模型输出有效信息很少，且容易输出**混杂或想象条目**；启用 Self-RAG 并选中 2 号 ctx 后，答案显著向**正确物种/片名集合**收敛，**错误项减少**。
- **幻觉降低**：典型失误（如把并非南美本土的物种误判为本土、或编造电影条目）在有**高相关证据**支撑后明显下降。
- **选择失误场景**：出现的 2/20 次 **误选 1 号无关 ctx**，对应答案质量仍偏弱——提示应**进一步提高阈值或改造负样本**（让“似是而非”更具迷惑性、训练时更有辨识价值）。
- **多信号加权的价值**：即便缺少人工金标，这组自评信号也能**内部排序**并挑选分数更高的回答；从最终选择分布（15 次选中 2 号）即可见其判别力。

------

## 可能的改进

- **负样本要“像真但不真”**：比起完全无关文本，**低相关但易混**的段落更能训练/考验模型的判别能力。
- **阈值可加严**：若发现模型偶尔使用无关 ctx，可尝试把 `--threshold` 提到 **0.3–0.5**；或调高 *utility/groundness* 的相对权重。
- **长度与格式控制**：让三类 ctx **长度相近、风格相近**，避免模型靠“段落长短/格式特征”取巧。
- **记录可解释信号**：保留每题的 *groundness/utility/seqscore* 与被选 ctx 的分数，便于定位失败样例与调参。

------

## 小结

在这 20 条小型评测中，Self-RAG 的**自评 + 自适应检索**机制让模型在绝大多数情况下选中了**高度相关证据（15/20）**，并据此**提高了答案的正确性**、**降低了幻觉**。与不检索相比，Self-RAG 能在**无需额外金标**的前提下，用内部打分**筛出更可信的输出**。

| Name some microorganisms that grow at low water activity levels. | Life forms capable of thriving at low water activity levels include xerophilic fungi such as Aspergillus conicus and osmotolerant yeasts like Debaryomyces hansenii, which can survive in extremely dry conditions. Desiccation-tolerant micro-animals include eutardigrade genera such as Ramazzottius and Pseudobiotus, remarkable for their ability to enter cryptobiotic states and survive extreme dehydration. Other organisms include tardigrades (Tardigrade, Eutardigrade) and species like Ramajendas, white-toothed woodrat, and white-throated woodrat, all employing various strategies including protective sugars, vitrified matrices, and specialized cell walls to endure aridity and osmotic stress, representing some of the most resilient life forms known. | 3.767988568          | 2                    | 1.I'm sorry, but I don't understand your question.Could you please rephrase it or provide more context? | Some microorganisms that grow at low water activity levels include xerophilic fungi, osmotolerant yeasts, and desiccation-tolerant micro-animals such as tardigrades. | Tardigrade Ramazzottius Aspergillus conicus White-toothed woodrat Eutardigrade Debaryomyces hansenii Pseudobiotus White-throated woodrat Ramajendas |
